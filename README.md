Title 

## **Validation of UML-based Family of Modelling Methods for Business Process**
 
Introduction 


The focus of this thesis is to study the family-based UML methods and evaluate them by modelling a collection of case studies covering all aspects of
the business process. The evaluation is done by comparing the results within the family-based UML models. With the help of UML modelling features,
all the aspects of the business process are precisely defined. Concerning the case studies, we have chosen the business processes modelled in BPMN
(Business Process Modelling Notation). BPMN uses many constructs to model a business process. While modelling a complex process with BPMN;
at some point, the diagram becomes unreadable and challenging to understand. The UML methods solve this issue by modelling each business process
precisely using only a few constructs. The BPMN shows the workflow of the business process in a single view. Whereas our UML models not only
show the workflow view but also allows the user to see the same business process with different views by increasing the understandability of the
process.


To understand how the BPMN works, we have followed the official BPMN documentation (https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/PDF). After
acquiring the knowledge of BPMN constructs, we have started modelling the business process by mapping the BPMN constructs to the constructs
that were defined in our UML models.


While modelling the BPMN case studies with our UML models, we have discovered the problems in BPMN related to the inconsistency and ambiguity
in defining the tasks, and we have solved them precisely using our models.


A comparative study of the results has been done within the UML models against BPMN case studies concerning the various values such as
producibility, readability, and understandability of the process.
